Sample2D
==============

I hadn't messed around seriously with writing physics code for a couple of years, and wanted to do something simple over the holiday break to brush up on it. This is based on the sequential impulse solving method Erin Catto describes in his GDC slides, and after getting stuck on a pieces (my time over the break was short, and my memory slow to come back), I ended up borrowing a few pieces from his Box2D_Lite sample to fill in gaps. This is a very sloppy codebase that was a hobby project done in a matter of several hours. Bugs galore I'm sure :)
